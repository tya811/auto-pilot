using, blender, k3d, flight gear, Kerbal Space program, any kind of weather simulator or forecast, and the new cool 3d map of the sea floor that 
NOAA just put out do the following. 

Simulate all the air, boat, and car traffic you can, simulate scenarios, think about any sort of scenario that could possibly exist, and code 
what the workaround would be using simulated gear like radar, sonar, lidar, color sensors and maps of weather and weather reports from other pilots. 

and then once you do that, you can develop what amounts to really perfect yacht, car, plane, gyro etcetera autopilot that would be ready to be
deployed in both analog and digital via home built computers. 

you have to take into consideration draft, downwash, waves, wind shear, trajectories, system failures and then just see how many hardware workarounds you can do
and then do the rest as software workarounds. a few electrical systems and a few backup motors can go a long way depending on the scenario. 

then you'll have great autopilot and great simulators, and flying with a keyboard with onscreen tutorials at the same time will be real. 

So like as you are in the plane in flight gear and taxiing, have a guide that tells you what you need to do next, and do that for yachting etcetera
and then it makes everything easy to learn. so like a guide telling you okay to land do this, bear this heading by doing this, set flaps to this

or like yacht parking, same thing, do this, put engines at this configuration, spin this direction, have someone do this, automate that and deploy this.
